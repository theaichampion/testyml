    A6 APIs provide you with access to capabilities that enable the Ingestion
    (/data), Analysis (/insights) and Distribution (/subscriptions) of sensor
    data at scale.


    Common use cases for A6 include:


    * To collect telematics data from internet connected sensors
     * To submit data to A6 use the Data API (POST)
     * To interact with A6 data (submit, read) a GroupID and SensorID are required; to acquire these identifiers, use the Group API and Sensor API, respectively.

    * To read data stored in A6 (data pull)
     * To read data stored in A6, use the Data API (GET)

    * To subscribe to data submitted to A6 (data push)
     * To identify the insights categories available for subscription, use the [Insight API
     * To subscribe to a particular insights category, use the Subscription API
     * To authorize a subscription, use the Entitlement API

    The purpose of this Swagger-enabled documentation is to help you understand
    how A6 works by allowing you to interact with each API yourself: click on
    the "Try it Out!" button in each section to submit real requests to each API
    and to view actual responses on screen.

      summary: Create a entitlement ID
      description: >-
        The Entitlement API is used by publishers (a developer submitting data
        to A6) to authorize subscribers with access to data submitted to A6. 
        The result of this action is the creation of an A6 "data entitlement".


        The ability to grant entitlements is required because by default, the
        only party with rights to read (/data) or receive (/subscriptions) data
        submitted to A6 is the developer submitting data (as defined by
        developer account credentials).


        To provide others with access to your data, use the Entitlements API
        (POST) to define the subscription ID you wish to authorize access to
        your data.


        You must acquire a subscription ID from the party requesting access to
        your data. A subscription ID is generated when a subscription is
        created. A6 does not facilitate the transfer of this ID – the transfer
        must happen out of band.


        **Important:** Retain access to the Entitlement ID provided after each
        Entitlement response. You will need this ID if you wish to revoke
        access/delete this entitlement in the future.

        include: vehicle trip, vehicle health.


        The request body must include a JSON payload.


        The following payloads will trigger the "vehicle.trip.arrived" and

        You must define the desired insight type when creating a subscription.


        One subscription supports multiple event types.


        **A note on subscriptions:**


        By default, the permissions scope for data submitted to A6 is locked
        down to the developer submitting the data.  If you create a subscription
        to an insights type, a publisher must explicitly provide you with
        permissions to the data before you will begin receiving data related to
        the category of your subscription. The Entitlement API can be used by
        publishers to enable an individual subscriber with access to the data
        they publish to A6.
